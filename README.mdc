# Project Implementation Summary

## Dynamic Frame Layout Implementation
Key implementation details and progress for the portfolio website's dynamic frame layout system.

### Core Components
1. **Dynamic Frame Layout Component**
   - Implemented a flexible frame system that supports both video and HTML content
   - Added hover effects and smooth transitions
   - Integrated frame decorations (corners and edges)
   - Supports responsive grid layout with dynamic sizing

### Content Integration
1. **Frame System**
   - Created SVG-based frame assets:
     - Corner elements (`frame-corner.svg`)
     - Horizontal edges (`frame-edge-horizontal.svg`)
     - Vertical edges (`frame-edge-vertical.svg`)
   - Implemented frame styling with:
     - White borders with black accents
     - Responsive scaling
     - Hover state animations

2. **Content Embedding**
   - Successfully integrated HTML-based content previews
   - Created preview templates for:
     - YouTube channel (`youtube.html`)
     - SoundCloud profile (`soundcloud.html`)
     - Writing portfolio (`writing.html`)
   - Implemented proper iframe handling for embedded content

### Technical Details
1. **Frame Configuration**
   ```typescript
   interface Frame {
     id: number
     content: {
       type: 'video' | 'html'
       src: string
     }
     defaultPos: { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number }
     corner: string
     edgeHorizontal: string
     edgeVertical: string
     mediaSize: number
     borderThickness: number
     borderSize: number
     isHovered: boolean
   }
   ```

2. **Layout Properties**
   - Grid-based positioning system
   - Dynamic hover states
   - Configurable gap sizes and hover expansion
   - Smooth transitions and animations

### Content Sources
1. **Media Integrations**
   - YouTube Channel: `UC8Zd9DahLXaEVxSBcqJhYHw`
   - SoundCloud Profile: Embedded player with profile content
   - Writing Portfolio: Interactive article preview

### Next Steps
1. **Content Population**
   - Add actual video content for previews
   - Customize frame styling to match brand
   - Fine-tune hover interactions
   - Add loading states for embedded content

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for iframes
   - Optimize frame assets
   - Add placeholder content for loading states

### Notes
- Frame system is built on shadcn/ui components
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements modern web practices (lazy loading, responsive design)
- Supports both static and interactive content 

# Project Development Summary

## Key Technical Decisions and Implementations

### UI Components and Interactions
1. **SplashCursor Implementation**
   - Successfully integrated a custom SplashCursor component for enhanced user interaction
   - Resolved pointer-events issues with BackgroundIllustration component
   - Ensured proper layering and mouse event handling for smooth interactions
   - Component now works correctly above background animations

### Typography and Styling
1. **Font System**
   - Initially explored Lineal font family implementation
   - Reverted to Subjectivity font family for better aesthetic alignment
   - Current implementation includes:
     - Full range of weights (100-800)
     - Both normal and italic styles
     - Proper font variable implementation with CSS variables
     - Fallback system fonts for optimal loading

2. **Font Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // Font variable implementation
   variable: '--font-subjectivity'
   
   // Tailwind configuration
   fontFamily: {
     sans: ['var(--font-subjectivity)', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif']
   }
   ```

### Best Practices Implemented
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Font display set to 'swap' for optimal loading performance
   - Proper font file formats (woff2) for modern browsers

2. **Accessibility**
   - Maintained proper contrast with font weights
   - Ensured text remains readable during font loading

### Technical Architecture
1. **Next.js Integration**
   - Proper local font loading using next/font/local
   - Font variables integrated with Tailwind CSS
   - Responsive layout structure with proper navigation setup

## Future Considerations
1. **Font Performance**
   - Monitor font loading performance
   - Consider preloading critical font weights
   - Evaluate font subsetting if needed

2. **Component Interactions**
   - Continue monitoring SplashCursor performance
   - Ensure smooth interactions across different device types

This summary represents the key technical decisions and implementations that form the foundation of the project. These choices were made to ensure optimal performance, accessibility, and user experience.
