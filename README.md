# Rian Kochel Portfolio

## Project Progress Summary

### Core Components Implementation
1. **Hero Component**
   - Dynamic phrase rotation with smooth animations
   - Two-phase animation system:
     - Initial fast cycling through phrases
     - Settling on a random phrase with fade transition
   - Responsive grid layout with 5/7 column split
   - Semi-transparent backdrop blur for content area

2. **Background Video Animation**
   - Custom video background with advanced masking and blending
   - Key features:
     - Radial gradient mask for seamless edge fading (35% to 85%)
     - Rounded corners (rounded-3xl) with overflow control
     - Mix-blend modes for white space handling:
       - Screen blend for video content
       - Multiply blend for background tint
       - Overlay blend for gradients
     - Subtle floating animation:
       - Centered movement range (±50px)
       - Scale variation (0.98 to 1.08)
       - 8-second animation cycle
     - Enhanced visual integration:
       - Cross-directional gradient overlays
       - Brightness and contrast adjustments
       - Black tint overlay (10% opacity)
     - Performance optimizations:
       - CSS-based masking
       - Hardware-accelerated animations
       - Efficient blend mode layering

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Smooth hover state transitions
   - Backdrop blur effects for depth

### Technical Achievements
1. **Animation System**
   - Framer Motion integration for smooth transitions
   - Coordinated multi-layer animations
   - Performance-optimized animation cycles

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Fluid typography scaling
   - Grid-based layout system
   - Viewport-aware positioning
   - Mobile-friendly structure

3. **Visual Effects**
   - Layered opacity management
   - Blur effects for depth
   - Dynamic contrast adjustments
   - Smooth transitions between states

### Core Features
- Dynamic content rotation
- Animated background elements
- Interactive cursor effects
- Responsive layout system
- Performance-optimized animations
- Accessibility considerations

## Development Notes
- Keep background illustration opacity between 0.2-0.35 for optimal visibility
- Maintain 8-second animation cycles for smooth transitions
- Preserve backdrop blur effects for depth perception
- Monitor performance impact of continuous animations

### Background Video Implementation Notes
- Video format: MP4 for optimal web compatibility
- Location: `/public/videos/herobackgroundanimation.mp4`
- Key CSS classes:
  ```css
  // Container masking
  [mask-image:radial-gradient(circle_at_center,_black_35%,_transparent_85%)]
  
  // Video blending
  mix-blend-screen brightness-125 contrast-125
  
  // Gradient overlays
  bg-gradient-to-t from-white/15 via-transparent to-white/15
  bg-gradient-to-r from-white/15 via-transparent to-white/15
  ```
- Animation values:
  - Position range: ±50px (x, y)
  - Scale range: 0.98 to 1.08
  - Opacity range: 0.3 to 0.45
  - Animation duration: 8 seconds 

### Recent Updates - Hero Component Refinements
#### Changes Made on [Current Date]
1. **Layout & Positioning**
   - Repositioned text elements for better visual hierarchy:
     - "Rian Kochel is..." moved to top edge of viewport
     - Rotating phrases positioned at bottom edge
     - Both elements centered horizontally
   - Adjusted viewport scaling:
     - Reduced overall content size by 15%
     - Added more whitespace with increased padding
     - Final padding values: py-44 (vertical) and px-34 (horizontal)

2. **Typography & Styling**
   - Updated text sizes for better proportions:
     - Header text: text-4xl (reduced from text-5xl)
     - Rotating phrases: text-[2.5rem] (reduced from text-[3rem])
   - Changed rotating phrase color to white for better contrast
   - Maintained bold weight for improved readability
   - Removed text shadow for cleaner appearance

3. **Animation & Timing**
   - Refined phrase rotation timing:
     - 7-second total cycle
     - 2-second gap between phrases
     - 3-second animation duration
     - 2.5-second opacity transition
   - Enhanced fade effects:
     - Smoother transitions with easeInOut timing
     - Gradual opacity changes
     - Subtle vertical movement during transitions

4. **Background Integration**
   - Updated background gradient:
     - Changed to radial gradient
     - Black to slate grey transition
     - Increased video masking by 15%
     - Improved contrast for text visibility

5. **Technical Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Key timing values
   - Animation duration: 3s
   - Opacity transition: 2.5s
   - Phrase gap: 2s
   - Total cycle: 7s
   
   // Layout values
   - Vertical padding: py-44
   - Horizontal padding: px-34
   - Text sizes: text-4xl, text-[2.5rem]
   ```

6. **Component Structure**
   - Maintained clean separation between static and animated content
   - Improved accessibility with semantic HTML
   - Enhanced maintainability with modular animation logic
   - Added proper TypeScript typing for better type safety

### Next Steps
- Monitor performance over extended periods
- Gather user feedback on animation timing
- Consider adding configurable animation speeds
- Explore additional animation variations for future updates
