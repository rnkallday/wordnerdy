## Project Progress Summary

### Core Components Implementation
1. **Hero Component**
   - Dynamic phrase rotation with smooth animations
   - Two-phase animation system:
     - Initial fast cycling through phrases
     - Settling on a random phrase with fade transition
   - Responsive grid layout with 5/7 column split
   - Semi-transparent backdrop blur for content area

2. **Background Illustration**
   - Animated floating illustration with subtle movements
   - Key features:
     - Smooth opacity transitions (0.2 to 0.35)
     - Random position shifts every 8 seconds
     - Moderate scale variations (0.95 to 2.15)
     - Contrast and brightness enhancements
     - Responsive sizing with max-width constraints

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Smooth hover state transitions
   - Backdrop blur effects for depth

### Technical Achievements
1. **Animation System**
   - Framer Motion integration for smooth transitions
   - Coordinated multi-layer animations
   - Performance-optimized animation cycles

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Fluid typography scaling
   - Grid-based layout system
   - Viewport-aware positioning
   - Mobile-friendly structure

3. **Visual Effects**
   - Layered opacity management
   - Blur effects for depth
   - Dynamic contrast adjustments
   - Smooth transitions between states

### Core Features
- Dynamic content rotation
- Animated background elements
- Interactive cursor effects
- Responsive layout system
- Performance-optimized animations
- Accessibility considerations

## Development Notes
- Keep background illustration opacity between 0.2-0.35 for optimal visibility
- Maintain 8-second animation cycles for smooth transitions
- Preserve backdrop blur effects for depth perception
- Monitor performance impact of continuous animations
